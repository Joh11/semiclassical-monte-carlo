* TODO How it works
1. [X] Generate a random state vector
2. [X] Monte Carlo steps for convergence
3. [X] Compute known values, like energy or magnetization
4. [X] Determine the step for decorrelation
5. [X] Write RK8 (Dormand-Prince)
6. [ ] Compute (dynamical) structural factor
7. [ ] Put everything together

* Data format
- state vector : =(3, Ns, Nx, Ny)=
